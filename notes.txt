DAY2
Data structure: Storing and arranging data in memory in some particular way so as to achieve some efficiency

ARRAY:
Array is a data structure where elements are stored in continous memory locations
Simplest DS and easy to use with help of subscript
Array is time efficient data structure
Array is space inefficient data structure
Accessing any unit in Array is BigO(1)

NOTE:
The DS to which we can apply subscript is called ordered DS

LINKED LISTS:
Linked list is space efficient data structure
Linked list is time inefficient data structure
Accessing any unit in Linked list is BigO(n)

Space time trade-off: Compromising one of the quantity for the other

how exactly elements are stored is physical view
how exactly elements are seen is conceptual / logical view

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
+ - * / // % **
I/P are numbers
O/P is number
All are binary operators
uses infix notation
ALl operators except ** have left to right associativity
5 + 5.5
Here 5 is implicity casted to float and then the addition is done.
The precedence of + and - is less than the other
what is evaluated first is the operator having highest precedence i.e., **
therefore precedence operator takes over the associativity
The infix notation expressions are converted to postfix and then evaluated

1.convert infix expression to postfix
2.evaluate postfix expression
3.find Nth term of the series 1 2 2 3 3 5 5 7 8 11 13 13
Odd terms:  1 2 3 5  8  13 21(fibonaccci series)
Even terms: 2 3 5 7 11 13(prime series)
when n is odd print (n/2)+1th term from fibonaccci series
when n is even print (n/2)th term from prime series

4.Accept a number and find the next smallest possible bigger number that must have all digits as the input number. If such a number is not possible to be created then print not possible
i/p num stored in Array
re arrange the numbers and check if it is greater than the input number in a loop and store the smallest larger number in another variable
print the variable as output

Start from units place
Look for the next digit which is smaller than the current digit
Mark the position of the smallest digit
swap digits ( ?? )
Sort digits after the position in ?? order 

Do we have a main function in python? 
Yes we have
the global code is implicity put into __main__()

Stratergy used across is functional programming
